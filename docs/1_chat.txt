phil: yay
phil: not sure why that's a bug
phil: but oh well I'll fix it later
adam: haha awesome
phil: so yeah, rts chess :)
phil: you can only spawn pieces on the first rank
phil: and pawns on the 2nd
phil: everything else works like regular chess (except no checkmate detection yet)
phil: u gonna move?
adam: i clicked the rook to spawn
adam: but can't spawn it
phil: you drag it on the board
phil: like a piece
adam: oh nice
phil: check
phil: :)
phil: lets go kasparov
phil: :)
adam: this game's amazing, you need to make it into a mobile app ASAP
phil: hehe
phil: I suppose since its a web app, its already a mobile app :p
phil: I think that's checkmate
phil: How many resources do you have?
adam: 900
adam: gg
phil: gg
phil: you can win by using a bug
phil: but technically its a win for me :)
adam: i love it, this is awesome
adam: did you invent this variation
phil: next version I'm going to make will be real time
phil: because fuck waiting for the other guy to move
phil: :)
phil: and you'll get like 1 resource every second or something
phil: also I can resize the board very easily
phil: make it 5 by 5 squares
phil: Or 20 by 20 or whatever
phil: I guess I invented it since I came up with it
phil: But I'm sure someone else has had this idea too
phil: I mean there's chess variants like marsellaise chess where you can move a piece twice or you can move two pieces at once
phil: Not sure if there's been this kind of variant yet which is basically rts - you start with a small base and build up based on that using resources
adam: how would realtime work
phil: you just make moves
phil: without having to wait for the other guy
adam: so you could spawn a pawn
phil: so just like starcraft
adam: and have him run across the screen
phil: you'd have to build up a defense
phil: well yeah
phil: so you'd probably need a rook to keep the back rank clear in the beginning
phil: and a couple pawns in front of your kinds to screen
phil: and then you can develop a solid offense with pieces
adam: cool i'd love to try that
phil: cause you know how even in starcraft
phil: you have cheese like sixpool and whatnot
adam: yeah
phil: so that would be the equivalent of spawning a bunch of pawns at the beginning hoping one goes through
phil: and the rook isnt fast enough to capture them all lol
phil: the only problem is avoiding deadlocks and conflicts in that
phil: keeping everything in sync
phil: or maybe
phil: a compromise
phil: where its turn based but you got 10 seconds to make a turn
phil: and then you lose your turn and the other guy goes
phil: that makes the technical aspects simple while keeping it rts paced
adam: haha what if your opponent gets 1 resource/second
phil: yeah
phil: that's how i did it initially
adam: you'd be rich against me
phil: hehe
phil: maybe you make resources during your opponents time
phil: so that is another incentive to move fast
adam: i know a guy who'd love to try this out, do you have to admin it?
phil: go back to gchat, i'm closing this out
