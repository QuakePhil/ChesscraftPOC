2013-08-13 - C port from half baked PHP code
2013-08-14 - Working on porting moves
2013-08-15 - Basic moves without check detection
2013-08-16 - Basic in check detection, perft good up to depth 4 (known depth 5 includes en passant)
           - Common bugs in move detection - queen moved as bishop OR (not AND) rook because of else if
           - And d2-d4 (and similar) were hopping over pieces
           - Basic think() with quiescent alpha beta (thx chessprogramming wikispaces)
2013-08-17 - Tested search for some mates, looks like it works, along with stalemate
2013-08-18 - Beginnings of a C<->PHP interface with timed bestmove()

2013-08-20 - Search limiter based on time, interface with PHP

todo: Why is bestmove.php not working? see second board

note: if engine is given a position where it is player a to move and playr b is in check (impossible)
it keeps on trucking


implement ttl and node_counter in quiesce

implement variable board size positional values

implement move ordering
move ordering in quescence and captures in general
value of captured - value of capturer 

some 1 ply search too slow (put down a buncha pawns)
so fix search timeout to account for that

implement promotion (always queen)
